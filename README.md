# Tour-Budget-Manager
Suppose, you along with your friends want to go on a tour after the pandemic is over. Fortunately, a tourist forum provides all the transportation costs from one spot to another where a road is available. Now as a programmer in your group you are given the task to find the estimated travel cost of the tour. To do so, you have to find the maximum spots that can be visited with the guaranteed minimum cost. After visiting the last spot in your list, you have to return to the first spot where you will catch the bus. But you and your friends are too tired to visit all the spots again to reach the starting spot; so you must find the shortest route to return to the first spot. After considering all these, calculate the travel cost.
